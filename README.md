# Shiny for Production
## EARL London 2019

This repository contains materials for the "Shiny for Production" workshop at EARL London 2019.

Before the workshop, please:

* Clone or download this repository to your computer
* Open the `setup.R` file and read through it carefully, making sure to perform any necessary installation steps, and to run the command which downloads the data we'll be using. (One of the downloaded files is rather large, so this may take a while - please be patient!)
* Double-check the `data` directory, and make sure you have both `flights08.csv` and `airports.csv` available. If they're not there, try running the code in `get_data.R` again.
